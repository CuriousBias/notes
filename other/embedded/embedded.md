Memory

## NOR
- Common for Boot code storage.
- Non volatile flash memory.
- Random access to memory locations.
- High speed. 
- Lower density and more expensive than NAND. 
- Can execute in place (XIP).

## DDR
- Double Data Rate Ram. 
- Volatile memory (lost when power removed).
- High speed. 
- Used as system memory.


## eMMC
- Embedded Multi Media Controller
- Combines NAND flash memory and memory controller. 
- Non volatile storage (stays when power removed).
